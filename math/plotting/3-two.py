Complete the following source code to plot x ↦ y1 and x ↦ y2 as line graphs:

The x-axis should be labeled Time (years)
The y-axis should be labeled Fraction Remaining
The title should be Exponential Decay of Radioactive Elements
The x-axis should range from 0 to 20,000
The y-axis should range from 0 to 1
x ↦ y1 should be plotted with a dashed red line
x ↦ y2 should be plotted with a solid green line
A legend labeling x ↦ y1 as C-14 and x ↦ y2 as Ra-226 should be placed in the upper right hand corner of the plot
